## Introduction

With the rise of fitness and bodybuilding culture, mass gainers have become a go-to solution for individuals struggling to gain weight and muscle mass. However, not all mass gainers are created equal. Some come with unwanted side effects that can derail your progress and impact your health. Understanding what to look for in a mass gainer is crucial to ensure safe, sustainable, and effective results.

## Common Side Effects of Mass Gainers

### 🚫 Digestive Issues
Many mass gainers are loaded with low-quality ingredients that can upset your stomach. High lactose content, excessive carbohydrates, or poor-quality protein sources often cause bloating, gas, or cramps.

### ⚠️ Unhealthy Weight Gain
Some products prioritize calorie count over quality. With high levels of sugar and unhealthy fats, users may gain fat instead of lean muscle.

### 🩺 Kidney Strain
Overloading on protein can strain your kidneys, especially for those with pre-existing conditions. Quality and quantity matter when it comes to protein intake.

### ❗ Allergic Reactions
Mass gainers that include allergens like soy, gluten, or dairy may trigger adverse reactions in sensitive individuals. Always read the label carefully.
